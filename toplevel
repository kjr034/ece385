/*

  Info: 
    The overall goal of htis prject is to create an MS Paint emulator using both hardware and software applications. Through the use
    of System on Chip (SOC), the project will have software and hardware communication. The overall control of the application will be using
    a C program, while the graphics controls and computations will be primarily carried out through hardware calculations.
    
    Two different input devices will be used in order to control the application. The first is a PS/2 mouse and the second is a USB
    controlled keyboard. The inputs from the keyboard and mouse will be first
